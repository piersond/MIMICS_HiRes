## Overview
Process base models are the most viable method for estimating soil C stocks and projecting soil C responses to changing conditions. However, while process model constructs are intentionally simplified versions of real world dynamics, the complexity of model parameterization presents a barrier for wider use by scientific and land management communities. Here, we've addressed that problem by creating a machine learning algorithm for parameterization of the MIMICS model, which has been folded into an automated routine. With the required data input from a user, the routine can parameterize MIMICS, fitting not only bulk SOC to field measures, but also the underlying soil C pools to known or expected ranges. (The parameterization routine is best run on a high performance computing platform, however the computing power required is not overwhelming to the extent that the routine cannot be run on most modern desktop computers). 

Weâ€™ve packaged the parameterization algorithm with a spatial data processing routine that is capable of producing spatial estimate maps of 0-30 cm soil C, litter C, microbial C, and protected C down to resolutions of 10 m2. The routine can also project and map the sensitivity of soil C stocks and the underlying C pools to changes in environmental conditions.  

## Basic steps for reproducing analyses and MIMICS model products

### 1. Generate dataset of 0-30 cm soil C stocks.

  * Harmonized soil data was originally downloaded from the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed and Critical Zone Observatory Database at http://data.reynoldscreekczo.org/shiny/RCSoDaH/. The database (.rds) was then processed in three steps (R scripts) to aggregate the available data into single values pertaining to the 0-30 cm stocks of SOC.

### 2. Find "best-fit" model parameters using a MCMC approach

 * Note: Using 31 cores on the ISU Supercomputer, and a calibration dataset with ~50 points, it takes ~2 hours to run the MCMC for 5000*3 iterations

### 3. Find "best-fit" model parameters using a MC approach

### 4. Using best-fit parameterization, create spatial maps from the MIMICS model
